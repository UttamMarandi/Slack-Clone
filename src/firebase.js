// connects firebase to the app
const firebaseApp = firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig)

//connect database to our app
const db = firebaseApp.firestore()

//get authentication
const auth = firebase.auth()


//we need to export db and auth to have access to those outside this file
export {db, auth}

//Bug FIxes
//1.Firebase module not found in src
//soluction(not worked) :checked the official documentation and follwed the process. App loaded but on sending data to db , new error : db.collection is not a function
//Solution : 
//checked the package.json and found firebase version to 9.10.0 , I think its not stable
//so rolled back to 8.10.0
//Now works
